# Build A Bear

Build A Bear is the first group project for Front End Module 1 at the Turing School of Software & Design. The goal was to build an application where users can create and save outfits for a digital teddy bear. Users can enter a title for each outfit they have created and wish to save. It focuses on creating a design that meets the general wireframe provided. It is intended for practice writigin well structured, semantic HTML with clean, percises CSS, as well as adding user interaction with JavaScript between a Data Model and the DOM.

* Understand how to implement client-side data persistence using localStorage
* Understand what it looks like to have a separate data model (using a class) and DOM model
* Incorporate and iterate over arrays in order to display data on the page
* Craft code with clean style, using small functions that show trends toward DRYness and SRP
