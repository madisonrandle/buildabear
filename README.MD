# Build A Bear

Build A Bear is the first group project for Front End Module 1 at the Turing School of Software & Design. The goal was to build an application where users can create and save outfits for a digital teddy bear. Users can enter a title for each outfit they want to save. This project focuses on creating a design that meets the general wireframe provided and is intended for practice writing well structured, semantic HTML with clean, percises CSS, as well as adding user interaction with JavaScript between a Data Model and the DOM.

## Team Members
* [Madison Randle](https://github.com/madisonrandle)
* [Megan Venetianer](https://github.com/megan-venetianer)
* [Taras Tarlov](https://github.com/ttarlov)

## Learning Goals
* Use a JavaScript class to store DRY, encapsulated data
* Understand how to implement client-side data persistence using localStorage
* Understand what it looks like to have a separate data model (using a class) and DOM model
* Incorporate and iterate over arrays in order to display data on the page
* Craft code with clean style, using small functions that show trends toward DRYness and SRP

## Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Set Up
1. Clone this repository
2. Run open index.html in the terminal command line
3. Select garments from each section on the left side of the page to dress the bear
4. Save your favorite outfits and dress the bear with these again at a later time

## Challenges
* Pressure to focus and manage our time on both the project and personal learning
* Having a two week break over the holidays and going back to a coding mindset
* Incorporating new concepts like, local storage and connecting a Data Model to the DOM
* Navigating different skill levels 

## Wins
* Having a two week break over the holidays to deepen our understanding of concepts we were struggling with individually
  * Objects and classes
  * Local storage
  * Refactoring
* Front loading
* Using grid
